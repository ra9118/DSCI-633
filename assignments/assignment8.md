## Preprocessing

### Build your own evaluation methods

#### Implement every function in [my_evaluation.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment8/my_evaluation.py)
Hint: compute self.confusion once and use it to calculate other metrics (except for auc).

### Test my_evaluation Algorithm with [A8.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment8/A8.py)
