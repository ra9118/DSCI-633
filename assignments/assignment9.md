## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Build your own Genetic Algorithm for tuning model parameters

#### Implement every function in [my_GA.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/my_GA.py)
Hint: check how [A9.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/A9.py) utilizes my_GA.py to tune my_DT learner.

### Test my_evaluation Algorithm with [A9.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/A9.py)
